# Axio Framework
My goal for the **Axio** Framework is to extend the same joy of coding, expressive power, elegance and efficiency to the *specific* area of web application development as is already provided by **Racket** more *generally*.

For the time being, this README will be a sketchpad of ideas that will eventually coalesce into Axio.

**Status update:** Although there has been little activity in this repository, I have been developing applications in Racket on a full time basis since November, 2018. After attending Racket Summer School in July, some of the macro-coding skills I'll need are coming along. I'm currently developing a significant web application in Racket for a startup, and I will be working on extracting the good parts into the Axio Framework over the next few months.
## Aspirations
* A **community** of leaders and contributors that is genuinely kind, thoughtful, patient and effective.
* A **codebase** that is correct, clear, concise, efficient and valuable.
* An **architecture** that is modular, flexible, adaptable and enduring.
* A **framework** that programmers enjoy creating and using.

## Initial Assumptions
Purely in the interest of time, the following are presently assumed:

* New releases may break things
* Operating systems: Mac **OSX** and **Linux**
* Database: **Postgres**
* Front end http server (for proxying, ssl, etc.): **Nginx**

## Racket Web Links
* [Spin](https://github.com/dmac/spin)

## Documentation
Notes from a helpful IRC #racket conversation:

* Add a mydocs.scrbl file, using #lang scribble/manual
* To compile by hand:
`scribble --html --redirect-main http://docs.racket-lang.org/ +m myfile.scrbl`
* To have cross-references between your own files, you need this too:
`--info-out myfile.sxref ++info-in other1.sxref ++info-in other2.sxref ++info-in other3.sxref â€¦`
* Make cross-references with `@section[#:tag "unique-name-across-all-files"]{My section}` and later (or in another file): `@secref{unique-name-across-all-files}` (hoping I didn't make any mistakes)
* if you're building a package, raco pkg install should build the docs too if you configured the package's info.rkt and other files properly.

Other info:

* [Scribble Docs](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/index.html)
* Examples:
    * [Threading package](https://github.com/lexi-lambda/threading/blob/master/threading-doc/scribblings/threading.scrbl)
    * [String module](https://github.com/racket/racket/blob/master/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/reference/strings.scrbl)

## Architecture Ideas
### Bootstrapping
### Web Server
* Allow for graceful restarts e.g. the equivalent of kill -USR2 for Unicorn
* Consider technical implications of streaming

Consider:

* [Puma](http://puma.io/)

### Web Server Interface
Allow for *plugging* functions into the request/response pipeline. One motivating personal example is a server-side fix for a syntax error in a request from an iPad client which would've taken too long to push through Apple approval. The solution was a simple function injected into Rack middleware.

[Mailing list discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/racket-users/M4byu6k7iNc)

Consider:

* [Elixir: Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug)
* [Ruby: Rack](http://rack.github.io/)
* [Python: WSGI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/)
* [Scala: Finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch)
* others?

### Authentication
* HTTP Basic
* HTTP Digest
* Form based

### Authorization
### Routing
See [Routing.md](https://github.com/AxioWebFramework/axio/blob/master/Routing.md)

* URL currying? i.e. (curry my-helper-url a b) vs. (my-helper a b c) and produce a partial URL

Consider:

* Ruby: Roda
    *  [website](http://roda.jeremyevans.net/why.html)
    *  [github](https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda)
* [Scala: Finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch)

### Input Validation
* Some Rails validators
    * inclusion_of
    * numericality_of
    * presence_of
    * absence_of
    * format_of - regex matching
    * uniqueness_of (database interaction)
* Finch uses [functions](https://github.com/finagle/finch/blob/master/docs/endpoint.md#validation)

### Session Handling
### Flash
### Controller Filters
### View Templates
[web-server/templates](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/templates.html   )
### Web Sockets
Consider:

* [Rails ActionCable](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable)

### Database
* Migrations
* Functional query building
* Caching

Consider:

* [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto)
* [Diesel](http://diesel.rs/)
* [Snooze](http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/untyped/snooze.plt/2/9/planet-docs/snooze/index.html)
* [Persistent](http://www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent)
* [JOOQ](http://www.jooq.org/)
* [Racquel](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racquel/index.html)

### Security

* Cross-site scripting
* Cross-site request forgery
* SQL injection
* String escaping
* etc.

### Code Reloading
The ability to simply refresh the browser after changing code and have the new file automatically loaded is extremely helpful.

### Asset Handling
* Minimize javascript/css
* Consolidate multiple javascript/css files
* Don't repeat the mistakes of the Rails *asset pipeline*

### Logging
* Associate log records from the same request e.g. thread/process id

### Continuations
[According to Jay](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/bTBj-RbMLDA/k80HNazuFAAJ), the web-server/servlet module uses continuations, but everything else in the web server does not.
### Other

* Background tasks
* Cookies
* Email
* File uploads
* JSON
* New project code generation
* Testing
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Deployment
* Open Source Reporting Services
  - Test Reporting
  - Code Coverage Reporting
